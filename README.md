# Story Vault

A story collection app built with the primary purpose of experimenting for an idea that I had, where users (i.e. creatives such as songwriters, novelists and comedians being the main target audience) can instantaneously document their experiences into "stories", which can be later used as a material source of inspiration.

Also built this app with the secondary purpose of improving my skills and learning how to implement Google Authentication in a full-stack environment.

## Built with:
- Express
- MongoDB
- Handlebars.js
- MaterializeCSS

### Dependencies
